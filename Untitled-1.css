TO DO:
1) Fix border-radius of images
2) Check, why upper menu is different in figma
3) Check top section font-sizes (compared to figma)
4) Check font-sizes in sections (compared to figma)
5) Fix section image container sizes










Container's numbers in figma:
1) Canvas width: 1920px
2) Container width: 1496px
3) Percentage width: 1496px of 1920px = 77.92%

Container's numbers in my laptop:
1) Canvas width: 1536px;
2) Container width: 1496px
3) Percentage width: 1496px of 1536px = 97.40% <- should be this


The problem was caused by extra safety-paddings (50px on each side).
